# Introduction

Hey there!

So you’re done playing in the treehouse or you’ve completed your codeschool.  You’ve been high-fiving Odin or your coding academy has kicked you out.  What now?

Now it's time that you build lots of awesome things and get great at what matters (and therefore what employers want).  The Next Step Ruby on Rails guides are all about that awkward *next step* after you've completed a few tutorials.  It's at this point, you're asking:

- What now?
- What should I build next?
- What other skills do I need to develop?
- What do I need to learn to get a job?

In the Next Step Ruby on Rails tutorials & books, I do my very best to introduce you to more advanced concepts around Ruby on Rails and also drive home the core learnings that create the foundation for any Ruby on Rails developer.

In this free guide, you'll learn the following skills that are often left out of the majority of other tutorials:

- Customising Devise for your requirements.
- AJAX & streamlining user experience.
- Image previews before uploading.
- JQuery & Rails.  How the two combine surprisingly well.
- Custom notifications feature for any web application.
- Adding 'likes' to a post or other component with Rails.
- Creating a follower / following relationship between your users, as seen on social networks such as Twitter or Instagram.
- Profile pages for individual users.

I sincerely hope this book helps you just as much as is has the readers of my blog.

If you'd like updates on my future projects, Next Step Ruby on Rails article series or actionable educational posts, [sign up here](https://www.devwalks.com/signup-now/) and I'll send you a quick email as soon as I release a new post / video / lesson.  I'm intending on re-writing this entire book using BDD, git workflows and going into much greater detail within each of the particular Rails features we're dealing with.  If that sounds like something that would float your boat, sign up above and I'll keep you posted (full disclosure:  that one will be a paid product).

Also, my primary way of feeding my children is with Rails or Meteor consulting, so if you have a project you'd like to work on together, feel free to send me an email at ben@devwalks.com.

All the very best,

**ps.**  This book WILL have a paid version that will be completely re-written for complete test-driven development, the number ONE requirement if you want a web development job / career.  The premium version will also:

- Go into much deeper descriptions of all of the Rails features and quirks.
- Have answers for all of the homework assigned in this book and the blog series.
- Have complete code samples for each step of the journey.
- Be updated for Rails 5.0 upon release.

You can pre-order the book [right here](https://gumroad.com/l/jHSeKq) and I'll have a glorious guide in your pretty hands before you know it.
